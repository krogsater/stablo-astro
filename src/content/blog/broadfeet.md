Something happened with my feet in my early 20s, I literally could not fit into any new shoes anymore. I was told that I had a broad feet and that shoe manufacturers are producing shoes even narrower then ever.

This lead to me trying every store in my local town to try to get ANY type of casual shoe, I had no luck and I was utterly frustrated and out of hope.

I remember wearing a pair of broken Mizunos for such a long time until I found some very ugly looking Asics which was hulk green and orange. It It was not great so I decided to try online shopping.
